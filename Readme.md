*Above condition only applied for day 1*

*Researched for next 2 days*

*Trying to make a local application*

*Please bear with me*

*I dont want the page to connect to internet..*

**Gotta make it PWA.. I think??**

**Browser to Browser is Hard enough... Too much work**

**Need to learn about Signalling ... Otherwise I'm going to be mad**

*I just wanted a cleaner code in Implementation 1.. So did Implementation 2... I didn't know ICE are added to localDescription at onIceCandidate event so failed misarably... Brooded for 1 day and started Implementation 3 ***Without any CSS*** and well found my mistake after comparing Implementation 2(I didn't show all SDP as well as ICE candidates so I was totally confused).. Now I'm not confused and know what I'm doing .. Bless me for the Completition of the project*
